The solution is:

Let the gas stations with their gas amounts be g1 , g2 , g3 ... gn. Let the amount of gas needed to go from station 1->2, 2->3 ... n->1 be a1, a2,... an.
Note that by the constraints of the question: g1 + g2 + g3 .. + gn = a1 + a2 + a3 ... an 
Also, we need g1 >= a1 , because the car starts with 0 gas at the starting station and needs to reach the station 2 to complete its journey.
Similarly, (g1 - a1) + g2 >= a2 , so that the car can reach station 3.
And so on we will have (n - 1) inequalities, with the last one being: (g1 - a1) + (g2 - a2) ... + g[n-1] >= a[n-1]
From the last inequality and the equation mentioned at the start, we have: an >= gn

So, the starting gas station can be found in with these following constraints: The first station must have enough gas to reach the second station and the last
station must have gas which is less than or equal to an, i.e, the gas required to reach from station n to station 1.

I beileve this is a rigorous enough way to find out the starting point. The 2 inequalities give us much information to choose a starting point. Also, we can use
all the inequalities to check for a starting point. The inequalities basically say that the partial sums have to be non-negative. But I dont think we will need
all the inequalities. The 1st and the last inequalities are itself a differentiating factor.
