The solution is:

Approach 1:
Maybe there is an Inductive proof.

We start with the base case of n = 2.
Let P(n) :- Alice is able to gurantee an acquisition of coins with sum greater than equal to that acquired by Bob for n(which is even) number of coins.

  Clearly, P(n = 2) is True, as Alice can always pickup the greater denomination coin. In case both the coins have equal denomination, P(n) still holds true.
  
  Assume that P(n = 4) and so on till P(n = k - 2) is True. We now try to prove that P(n = k) is True.
  
  
  

Approach 2:
Alice can pick all the odd indexed coins or all the even indexed coins. Either way, she can gurantee a greater than equal to sum.
